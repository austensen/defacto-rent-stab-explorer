# Defacto Rent Stabilized Properties Explorer

This app is designed to help identify properties in Brooklyn that could potentially become "defacto rent stabilized" because of illegal units, and provide useful information about the properties from public data for exploration and download. 

This app is built on top of the critical work done by [@aepyornis](https://github.com/aepyornis), and other members of the [Housing Data Coalition](https://www.housingdatanyc.org/), on the [NYC-DB](https://github.com/nycdb/nycdb) project.

**This project is currently in active development!**

## About the Housing Data Coalition

The [Housing Data Coalition (HDC)](https://www.housingdatanyc.org/) is a group of individuals and organizations who collaborate on the use of public data to further housing justice in New York City. In the face of the real estate industryâ€™s escalating exploitation of housing data to drive speculation and displacement, HDC seeks to make public data more accessible and actionable for housing justice groups. Through a structure of working groups and monthly meetings, HDC provides opportunities for members to connect, learn, and give mutual support to a variety of projects involving housing data.
